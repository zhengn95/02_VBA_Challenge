# VBA Challenge
Challenge 2 for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this assignment, we use VBA to analyze data

## Part  1: Loops to Calculate Yearly Change, Percentage Change, and Total Stock Volume
We created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock. 

## Part 2: Summary Table
We created a summary table. This added functionality to the script and returned the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

## Part 3: Conditional Formatting
We used conditional formatting that will highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

## Part 4: Enable Script to Run through Each Worksheet
Lastly, appropriate adjustments were made to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year).

## Summary of the Analysis 
Our analysis using VBA code calculated the percent change and total stock volume of various company stocks (represented by tickers) from 2018-2020. In 2018, the company with the greatest percent increase in stock value was THB at 142.42%, the company with the greatest percent decrease in stock value was RKS at -90.02%, and the company with the greatest total volume was QKN with 1,689,539,560,106 shares traded.

In 2019, the company with the greatest percent increase in stock value was RYU at 190.03%, the company with the greatest percent decrease in stock value was RKS at -91.06%, and the company with the greatest total volume was QKN with 4,373,008,528,422 shares traded.

In 2020, the company with the greatest percent increase in stock value was THB at 188.76%, the company with the greatest percent decrease in stock value was RKS at -89.05%, and the company with the greatest total volume was QKN with 3,452,956,568,861 shares traded.

The analysis allows us to follow past stock market trends to determine the potential successes and failures of each company stock and inherently the company itslef.
