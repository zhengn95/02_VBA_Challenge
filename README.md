# 02_VBA_Challenge
Challenge 2 for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this assignment, we use VBA to analyze data

## Part  1: Loops to Calculate Yearly Change, Percentage Change, and Total Stock Volume
We created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock. 

## Part 2: Summary Table
We created a summary table. This added functionality to the script and returned the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

## Part 3: Conditional Formatting
We used conditional formatting that will highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

## Part 4: Enable Script to Run through Each Worksheet
Lastly, appropriate adjustments were made to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year).
